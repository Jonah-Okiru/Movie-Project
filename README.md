# Movie Database

## Project Overview
Movie Database is a frontend web application designed to allow users to search for movies and view detailed information about them. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with an optional integration of Tailwind CSS, this project focuses on API integration, state management, and creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

This project simulates a real-world development environment, providing valuable experience in frontend web development, API handling, and deployment.

## Functional Requirements

1. Fetch Movie Data

Utilize a public movie API like OMDB API to fetch movie data based on user search queries.

Display a list of movies matching the search criteria, showing key details:

Movie Poster: Thumbnail image.

Title: Movie title.

Release Date: Year of release.

2. Movie Details View

When a user clicks on a movie, display additional details including:

Plot Summary: Brief description of the movie.

Cast: Main actors and their roles.

Ratings: Scores from various sources (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.).

Genre: Movie categories (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).

3. Search Functionality

Implement a search bar to allow users to type a movie name and retrieve relevant results.

Display a user-friendly message when no movies match the search query.

4. Responsive UI Design

Use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive layout adaptable to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Ensure easy navigation between the movie list and details view.

5. Error Handling

Handle network errors, invalid API responses, and empty search results.

Display clear and concise error messages to the user.

## Technical Requirements.

1. Project Setup

Set up a React project using Vite or a custom configuration.

Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling (or use another CSS framework if preferred).

2. API Integration

Sign up for an API key from OMDB or an equivalent movie database service.

Use fetch or axios to request and manage API data.

Display fetched data in a structured and visually appealing format.

3. User Interface Components

Create reusable UI components:

SearchBar: For entering movie queries.

MovieCard: For displaying each movie in the list.

MovieDetails: For showing in-depth movie information.

Maintain a cohesive UI with consistent colors, typography, and spacing using Tailwind CSS.

4. State Management

Utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage data fetching, user input, and UI updates.

Optionally, implement Zustand, Redux, or MobX-State-Tree if the application requires advanced state management.

5. Deployment

Deploy the completed application using Netlify or Vercel.

Ensure the deployed app is accessible, responsive, and performs well.

Share the deployment link as part of the project submission.
